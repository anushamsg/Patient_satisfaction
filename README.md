## Project Title

**Improving Patient Satisfaction on Discharge Instructions**

## Summary

This project investigates low patient satisfaction related to discharge instructions at Brookdale Hospital, a busy 538-bed facility in Brooklyn, NY. Using 2023 HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) data, the study identifies deficiencies, explores root causes through structured quality improvement tools, and proposes targeted interventions to improve discharge communication and post-discharge care.

## Problem Statement

Brookdale Hospital exhibits poor discharge satisfaction scores, contributing to inadequate post-hospital care, reduced patient outcomes, and increased readmission rates.

## SMART Goal

Increase Brookdale Hospital’s patient discharge satisfaction rating from 1 to 4 (out of 5) by April 2025.

## Methods

### Data Analysis

* Imported and filtered HCAHPS 2023 survey data
* Identified hospitals with average patient star ratings below 3
* Selected Brookdale Hospital for further investigation

### Quality Improvement Tools

* Root Cause Analysis (Fishbone Diagram)
* “5 Whys” Technique
* Risk Management Assessment
* PDSA Cycle (Plan–Do–Study–Act)

## Interventions Proposed

1. **Multimedia Discharge Instructions**

   * Provide personalized video animations for medications and care plans.

2. **Post-Discharge Follow-Up Program**

   * Establish a system for continuity of care and support after discharge.

3. **Family Involvement**

   * Include family members during discharge teaching to improve understanding and compliance.

## Root Causes Identified

* Inadequate communication by staff
* Lack of personalized, clear discharge information
* Absence of standardized follow-up procedures
* Patients overwhelmed or confused during discharge

## Outcome Measures

* Patient star rating scores on discharge communication
* Readmission rates within 30 days
* Patient-reported understanding of discharge instructions

## Recommendations

* Integrate digital tools (e.g., QR codes linking to instructional videos)
* Train staff on clear and empathetic communication strategies
* Create structured checklists and discharge protocols
* Monitor performance using continuous feedback from HCAHPS
